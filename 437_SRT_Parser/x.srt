Critical hit.
He couldn't have gone far.

3
00:00:29,334 --> 00:00:31,397
He wouldn't go
to a hospital.

The bleeder works for Kirk.
He'll know where to find them.

7
00:00:48,627 --> 00:00:50,183
I have a location.

8
00:00:52,272 --> 00:00:54,773
I was trying to help.
He has to know that.

9
00:00:54,883 --> 00:00:57,072
I'm not on your side here,
Kate.

00:01:40,289 --> 00:01:42,247
I need to speak
with the patient.

15
00:01:46,348 --> 00:01:47,783
He's gone.

16
00:01:53,946 --> 00:01:56,782
As you well know,
one of the keys to my success

17
00:01:56,852 --> 00:02:00,105
is a clear and consistent
understanding

18
00:02:00,203 --> 00:02:02,466
of my own limitations.

19
00:02:02,988 --> 00:02:06,567
So often people
overestimate themselves,

20
00:02:06,687 --> 00:02:08,724
misapply their gifts.

21
00:02:09,007 --> 00:02:13,196
The cleaner suddenly
fancies herself the strategist.

22
00:02:14,237 --> 00:02:16,226
Wisdom is
learning the boundaries

23
00:02:16,342 --> 00:02:18,955
of one's designated lane.

24
00:02:19,489 --> 00:02:23,386
For instance,
this, I will do poorly.

25
00:02:23,498 --> 00:02:27,770
Clumsily,
with more mess than necessary.

26
00:02:29,396 --> 00:02:31,135
It'll take longer

27
00:02:31,269 --> 00:02:34,610
and be considerably
more unpleasant to boot.

28
00:02:34,694 --> 00:02:37,643
But I can't very well
have you do it, can I?

29
00:02:50,685 --> 00:02:53,683
Raymond Reddington,
my favorite rubio.

30
00:02:54,070 --> 00:02:57,291
Ay carajo, I haven't seen you
since you snuck off at Carnival.

31
00:03:01,026 --> 00:03:02,834
Red, Jesus.

32
00:03:02,923 --> 00:03:04,242
What's wrong with you?

33
00:03:04,344 --> 00:03:06,209
We're looking for a name.

34
00:03:06,608 --> 00:03:08,408
Take a close look, Manny.

35
00:03:08,491 --> 00:03:12,186
He worked for a man who abducted
someone I care about.

36
00:03:12,437 --> 00:03:13,683
He's a cop.

37
00:03:13,771 --> 00:03:15,534
Who's his rabbi?

38
00:03:15,605 --> 00:03:18,872
I don't know,
but I know who might.

39
00:03:21,607 --> 00:03:23,696
- Is it true? She's alive?
- Apparently.

40
00:03:23,809 --> 00:03:25,166
Wait, wait.
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

41
00:03:25,300 --> 00:03:27,565
How is that... there were
complications during labor.

42
00:03:27,673 --> 00:03:29,346
And the doctor,
he declared her dead.

43
00:03:29,466 --> 00:03:30,574
He lied.

44
00:03:30,653 --> 00:03:32,600
But there was a funeral.
I-I was a pallbearer.

45
00:03:32,679 --> 00:03:34,530
Yes, and who knows
what was in that casket?

46
00:03:34,611 --> 00:03:35,652
It was a charade, Aram.

47
00:03:35,711 --> 00:03:39,046
So Agent Keen is alive?

48
00:03:40,823 --> 00:03:43,649
Uh, but her funeral
and her death...

49
00:03:43,872 --> 00:03:45,454
She faked her death.
Why would she do that?

50
00:03:45,543 --> 00:03:46,985
To get away from Reddington.

51
00:03:47,071 --> 00:03:49,444
So that her and Tom and Agnes
could have a normal life.

52
00:03:49,517 --> 00:03:50,324
Away from us?

53
00:03:50,392 --> 00:03:53,021
Yes, after everything
we did for her.

54
00:03:53,134 --> 00:03:54,071
Best we could tell,

55
00:03:54,164 --> 00:03:56,675
Liz and Tom's plan
was to go into hiding in Cuba.

56
00:03:56,751 --> 00:03:58,174
Alexander Kirk found them.

57
00:03:58,289 --> 00:03:59,920
Why? What does he want
with Agent Keen?

58
00:04:00,001 --> 00:04:01,130
Look, all we know right now
is that

59
00:04:01,223 --> 00:04:03,312
when Reddington got there,
Liz and Tom were gone.

60
00:04:03,399 --> 00:04:05,344
I just got off the phone
with the embassy in Havana.

61
00:04:05,465 --> 00:04:08,028
Briefed them on Kirk, gave them
the tail number to his plane.

62
00:04:08,112 --> 00:04:09,687
If that was how he was planning
to get off the island,

63
00:04:09,827 --> 00:04:12,504
- that's not gonna happen.
- And, uh, what about Agnes?

64
00:04:12,570 --> 00:04:15,670
At this point, we don't know.

65
00:04:15,855 --> 00:04:17,604
Notify FBI headquarters.

66
00:04:17,748 --> 00:04:19,970
Elizabeth Keen is alive.

67
00:04:25,473 --> 00:04:26,888
The plane is ready.

68
00:04:27,083 --> 00:04:28,428
Mato and the baby?

69
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:29,532
Not yet.

70
00:04:29,636 --> 00:04:31,632
Notify me
as soon as they're here.

71
00:04:32,584 --> 00:04:33,421
My baby.

72
00:04:33,519 --> 00:04:35,467
- She's on her way.
- That's what you said before.

73
00:04:35,546 --> 00:04:37,452
- Masha--
- My name is Elizabeth.

74
00:04:37,554 --> 00:04:40,763
I understand that you have
questions, that you're upset.

75
00:04:50,794 --> 00:04:52,593
I'm sorry it has to be
like this.

76
00:04:52,677 --> 00:04:55,521
- You're not my father.
- Well, I am, Masha. I am.

77
00:04:55,605 --> 00:04:57,214
And I intend
to prove that to you.

78
00:04:57,319 --> 00:04:58,378
Agnes will be brought here,

79
00:04:58,465 --> 00:05:00,654
but the person doing that has
a job to do first.

80
00:05:00,748 --> 00:05:03,505
What job? With Tom?

81
00:05:05,318 --> 00:05:06,880
What are you doing to Tom?

82
00:05:16,410 --> 00:05:17,952
Let me out!

83
00:05:41,835 --> 00:05:42,963
_

84
00:05:43,094 --> 00:05:44,471
_

85
00:05:49,430 --> 00:05:50,516
_

86
00:05:58,962 --> 00:06:00,921
Oh.

87
00:06:01,071 --> 00:06:04,815
There's nothing more depressing
than a failed Communist state.

88
00:06:04,995 --> 00:06:07,420
It doesn't even really pay
to be corrupt.

89
00:06:07,550 --> 00:06:10,313
When dirty cops
play poker in America,

90
00:06:10,453 --> 00:06:12,801
they're able to play
for real money.

91
00:06:13,126 --> 00:06:14,698
Let's raise the stakes.

92
00:06:14,792 --> 00:06:16,369
_

93
00:06:16,463 --> 00:06:17,671
_

94
00:06:17,782 --> 00:06:19,826
_

95
00:06:28,252 --> 00:06:30,033
A new game.

96
00:06:30,206 --> 00:06:32,281
You tell me who the head
worked for,

97
00:06:32,364 --> 00:06:35,057
you keep the money,
a 5-way split.

98
00:06:35,165 --> 00:06:37,877
Oh, we're keeping the money.

99
00:06:39,651 --> 00:06:42,237
A young woman and her child
were taken.

100
00:06:42,656 --> 00:06:44,484
A Russian has entered
the country.

101
00:06:44,564 --> 00:06:45,773
I have it on good authority

102
00:06:45,885 --> 00:06:48,444
your friend here
was assisting him.

103
00:06:48,517 --> 00:06:50,007
I think it's time
for you to leave.

104
00:06:53,547 --> 00:06:54,918
Make that a 4-way split.

105
00:06:55,001 --> 00:06:57,482
_

106
00:07:05,221 --> 00:07:06,584
I'll give you a name.

107
00:07:07,007 --> 00:07:09,282
Well, isn't this
your lucky day?

108
00:07:12,315 --> 00:07:14,887
The head worked for
a Jhosep Balzan?

109
00:07:14,951 --> 00:07:16,221
I've never heard of him.

110
00:07:16,286 --> 00:07:18,469
Yeah, he's a supplier
of all manner of contraband

111
00:07:18,575 --> 00:07:19,774
on the island.

112
00:07:19,883 --> 00:07:21,800
If the people you're looking for
are still in Cuba,

113
00:07:21,943 --> 00:07:23,910
Balzan is protecting them.

114
00:07:24,017 --> 00:07:25,502
Should I assemble a team?

115
00:07:26,524 --> 00:07:28,890
Dembe, call Silvio in
San Cristobal.

116
00:07:28,978 --> 00:07:31,531
Tell him to put a team together.
We're going after Elizabeth.

117

Here.

119
00:07:49,333 --> 00:07:52,100
You think I'd drug you?

120
00:07:52,102 --> 00:07:54,102
You kidnapped
my infant daughter,

121
00:07:54,104 --> 00:07:55,971
my husband, and me.

122
00:07:55,973 --> 00:07:58,206
I'd say you're capable
of anything.

123
00:07:58,208 --> 00:07:59,674
Listen...

124
00:07:59,676 --> 00:08:03,077
you were my entire life.

125
00:08:03,079 --> 00:08:05,847
You were all your mother and I
ever cared about.

126
00:08:05,849 --> 00:08:07,982
Now you don't know
any of that

127
00:08:07,984 --> 00:08:09,984
because Reddington took you
away from us

128
00:08:09,986 --> 00:08:12,487
when you were just
a little girl.

129
00:08:12,489 --> 00:08:16,190
He and your mother
had an affair.

130
00:08:16,192 --> 00:08:19,060
For a time, I thought
maybe he was the father,

131
00:08:19,062 --> 00:08:21,996
but I have proof that
he's not.

132
00:08:21,998 --> 00:08:26,334
He's just a spiteful,
evil man.

133
00:08:26,336 --> 00:08:30,204
Couldn't accept it when Katarina
broke off the affair.

134
00:08:30,206 --> 00:08:32,739
One day I came home,
and you were gone.

135
00:08:32,741 --> 00:08:34,374
He'd taken you.

136
00:08:34,376 --> 00:08:37,578
I never thought
I'd ever see you again...

137
00:08:37,580 --> 00:08:40,647
until there you were
in the news,

138
00:08:40,649 --> 00:08:43,750
you... and Reddington,

139
00:08:43,752 --> 00:08:45,418
the most wanted fugitives
in the world.

140
00:08:45,420 --> 00:08:48,489
If you cared so much about me,
you wouldn't hold me hostage.

141
00:08:48,491 --> 00:08:51,458
He'd taken my beautiful child
and turned her into a criminal.

142
00:08:51,460 --> 00:08:52,825
Attack my wedding,
everyone I love.

143
00:08:52,827 --> 00:08:56,196
Everything I did was to get
my child away from Reddington.

144
00:08:56,198 --> 00:08:58,164
Who understands that
more than you?

145
00:08:58,166 --> 00:08:59,565
You did the exact same thing,

146
00:08:59,567 --> 00:09:03,536
faked your own death
to get your child away from him.

147
00:09:06,608 --> 00:09:08,407
We have a problem.

148
00:09:08,409 --> 00:09:10,142
The PNR have surrounded
the plane.

149
00:09:10,144 --> 00:09:11,777
Then find another plane.

150
00:09:14,549 --> 00:09:16,281
Agnes will be here shortly.

151
00:09:16,283 --> 00:09:17,984
And Tom?

152
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:36,801
_

153
00:09:36,802 --> 00:09:38,002
_

154
00:09:38,039 --> 00:09:39,170
Shh!

155
00:09:39,172 --> 00:09:40,906
Hey, they have my baby! Please!

156
00:09:40,908 --> 00:09:44,676
Keen, you breathe a word,
I'm gonna fire two bullets--

157
00:09:44,678 --> 00:09:46,110
one in the cop

158
00:09:46,112 --> 00:09:48,513
and the other between the eyes
of that screaming kid.

159
00:09:48,515 --> 00:09:49,881
You got it?

160
00:09:49,883 --> 00:09:51,149
_

161
00:09:58,480 --> 00:09:59,986
_

162
00:10:01,256 --> 00:10:02,904
_

163
00:10:09,023 --> 00:10:10,220

_

166
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:29,119
He's got a gun!

167
00:10:39,831 --> 00:10:40,930
No, don't-- please!

168
00:10:57,548 --> 00:10:59,816
Where are we on Kirk?

169
00:10:59,818 --> 00:11:02,151
PNR grounded his plane.
There's no sign of him or Keen.

170
00:11:02,153 --> 00:11:03,285
I informed the Bureau

171
00:11:03,287 --> 00:11:05,521
that Elizabeth Keen has risen
from the dead.

172
00:11:05,523 --> 00:11:06,989
They said three Hail Mary's

173
00:11:06,991 --> 00:11:09,658
and they're on the lookout
for the zombie apocalypse.

174
00:11:09,660 --> 00:11:11,960
I understand. You feel played.

175
00:11:11,962 --> 00:11:13,596
Don't you, sir?

176
00:11:13,598 --> 00:11:15,831
Look, we should
be halfway to Havana by now.

177
00:11:15,833 --> 00:11:17,799
Why? She obviously
doesn't want our help.

178
00:11:17,801 --> 00:11:21,202
Maybe or maybe not,
but she needs it.

179
00:11:21,204 --> 00:11:23,071
You're willing to risk your life
after what she did?

180
00:11:23,073 --> 00:11:25,140
All right, let's just have
this conversation.

181
00:11:25,142 --> 00:11:27,242
Keen lied to us,
took advantage of all of us,

182
00:11:27,244 --> 00:11:29,811
and no one is more upset
about that than I.

183
00:11:29,813 --> 00:11:32,480
Or... relieved.

184
00:11:32,482 --> 00:11:34,649
Truth be told, I didn't think
it was possible

185
00:11:34,651 --> 00:11:37,519
to be this joyous and livid
at the same time.

186
00:11:37,521 --> 00:11:39,053
But I have a job to do--

187
00:11:39,055 --> 00:11:42,157
find Keen and her family
and bring them home safely.

188
00:11:42,159 --> 00:11:45,926
And I know that no matter
how I feel, I can do that job.

189
00:11:45,928 --> 00:11:48,663
I need to know if each of you
can say the same.

<i>Hello, Raymond.</i>

203
00:13:21,354 --> 00:13:23,488
Elizabeth, are you okay?

204
00:13:23,490 --> 00:13:24,956
Of course she is.

205
00:13:24,958 --> 00:13:27,459
Unlike you, I would never hurt
my own daughter.

206
00:13:30,463 --> 00:13:32,629
<i>Elizabeth?</i>

207
00:13:32,631 --> 00:13:34,231
<i>- Elizabeth.</i>
- I'm on your left.

208
00:13:46,512 --> 00:13:48,144
Constantin.

209
00:13:48,146 --> 00:13:51,548
What do you want? Name it.

210
00:13:51,550 --> 00:13:53,884
You bring her out unharmed,
you'll have it.

211
00:13:53,886 --> 00:13:57,721
Of course, the Concierge
of Crime wants to cut a deal.

212
00:13:57,723 --> 00:13:59,222
You'll give me whatever I want?

213
00:13:59,224 --> 00:14:00,591
<i>Yes.</i>

214
00:14:00,593 --> 00:14:02,693
In exchange for Masha?

215
00:14:02,695 --> 00:14:05,395
<i>Whatever you desire.</i>

216
00:14:05,397 --> 00:14:08,531
What I desire
is to raise my child,

217
00:14:08,533 --> 00:14:10,266
to watch her grow,

218
00:14:10,268 --> 00:14:13,103
and to have back the 26 years
of being a father

219
00:14:13,105 --> 00:14:14,537
that you took from me.

220
00:14:14,539 --> 00:14:16,572
But you can't give me that,
can you?

221
00:14:16,574 --> 00:14:21,377
<i>No, because she was
never yours to raise.</i>

222
00:14:23,948 --> 00:14:26,081
Patrol unit incoming.

223
00:14:26,083 --> 00:14:28,518
Military patrol.
Armored military.

224
00:14:30,087 --> 00:14:32,688
- Agnes. Do you have Agnes?
- I don't have her.

225
00:14:32,690 --> 00:14:34,991
<i>Go. Find Agnes and Tom.</i>

226
00:14:36,494 --> 00:14:38,193
I'm not leaving here
without you.

227
00:14:38,195 --> 00:14:39,928
You just don't get it,
do you, Raymond?

228
00:14:39,930 --> 00:14:41,930
She doesn't want to be with you.
That's why she faked

229
00:14:41,932 --> 00:14:43,465
her own death--
to get away from you.

230
00:14:43,467 --> 00:14:45,100
Raymond, we have to go now.

231
00:14:45,102 --> 00:14:46,535
- If they get you, they'll kill you.
- Raymond.

232
00:14:46,537 --> 00:14:49,338
Did you hear me?
You have to go.

233
00:14:49,340 --> 00:14:51,706
Go!

234
00:14:51,708 --> 00:14:54,242
Elizabeth, I will come for you.

235
00:15:13,236 --> 00:15:15,403
Harold, gather your team.

236
00:15:15,405 --> 00:15:17,438
Reddington. Where are you?

237
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:19,273
Tell me you have Agent Keen.

238
00:15:19,275 --> 00:15:21,976
<i>No, but she's still
on the island.</i>

239
00:15:21,978 --> 00:15:24,112
<i>Kirk's preparing her exit plan.</i>

240
00:15:24,114 --> 00:15:25,779
I don't know what
the preparations are,

241
00:15:25,781 --> 00:15:29,216
but I know who can find out--
Manuel Esteban.

242
00:15:29,218 --> 00:15:30,751
The Chilean Spymaster?

243
00:15:30,753 --> 00:15:33,654
- Who's Esteban?
- Our next Blacklister.

244
00:15:33,656 --> 00:15:36,123
Manuel Orentez Esteban.

245
00:15:36,125 --> 00:15:37,892
Leader of Pinochet's Caravan of Death

246
00:15:37,894 --> 00:15:38,926
that institutionalized

247
00:15:38,928 --> 00:15:40,895
a state-sponsored
system of terror

248
00:15:40,897 --> 00:15:43,630
through abuse, abduction,
and murder.

249
00:15:43,632 --> 00:15:46,599
According to our database,
he died in 1989.

250
00:15:46,601 --> 00:15:48,035
Except he didn't.

251
00:15:48,037 --> 00:15:51,104
Esteban is alive and well
and a legendary enforcer

252
00:15:51,106 --> 00:15:53,573
for a series of
authoritarian regimes.

253
00:15:53,575 --> 00:15:55,742
Assuming what you say is true
and Esteban is alive,

254
00:15:55,744 --> 00:15:57,877
what makes you think he can
help locate Keen?

255
00:15:57,879 --> 00:16:00,647
<i>Kirk's man in Cuba
is protected by the military.</i>

256
00:16:00,649 --> 00:16:03,850
<i>If the military is involved,
Esteban will know about it.</i>

257
00:16:03,852 --> 00:16:05,518
We'll never find Esteban
in time.

258
00:16:05,520 --> 00:16:06,753
We have no assets in Cuba.

259
00:16:06,755 --> 00:16:08,588
Of course you do, Harold.

260
00:16:08,590 --> 00:16:11,323
Esteban.
He works for your government.

261
00:16:11,325 --> 00:16:14,160
<i>Castro took him in,
and the CIA immediately</i>

262
00:16:14,162 --> 00:16:16,562
<i>put him on the payroll
as a double agent.</i>

263
00:16:16,564 --> 00:16:17,930
What little you know

264
00:16:17,932 --> 00:16:20,533
about the inner workings
of the Cuban government

265
00:16:20,535 --> 00:16:22,935
<i>is courtesy of Manuel Esteban.</i>

266
00:16:22,937 --> 00:16:24,836
The CIA knows where to find him,

267
00:16:24,838 --> 00:16:27,273
and he knows
where to find Elizabeth.

268
00:16:27,275 --> 00:16:31,043

280
00:17:55,926 --> 00:17:57,726
What are you talking
to Reddington for?

281
00:17:57,728 --> 00:17:59,529
I thought
your task force was disbanded

282
00:17:59,531 --> 00:18:00,763
after Agent Keen's death.

283
00:18:00,765 --> 00:18:03,466
It turns out she's not dead.
She's been kidnapped.

284
00:18:03,468 --> 00:18:04,800
And if we have any hope
for finding her,

285
00:18:04,802 --> 00:18:06,001
it rests in finding Esteban.

286
00:18:06,003 --> 00:18:07,403
I need to know
where to find him.

287
00:18:07,405 --> 00:18:10,806
I hate getting
into bed with Reddington.

288
00:18:10,808 --> 00:18:14,176
I... hate needing him

289
00:18:14,178 --> 00:18:16,478
and his list.

290
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:19,848
If you find Agent Keen, will he
continue to give you names?

291
00:18:19,850 --> 00:18:21,984
He just did-- Esteban.

292
00:18:21,986 --> 00:18:24,252
According to him,
Esteban works for the Agency.

293
00:18:27,024 --> 00:18:28,190
Good Lord.

294
00:18:28,192 --> 00:18:31,059
Is there anything that man
doesn't know?

295
00:18:31,061 --> 00:18:32,527
How can we contact him?

296
00:18:32,529 --> 00:18:34,429
The Agency
reaches out to him

297
00:18:34,431 --> 00:18:36,864
through the State Department's
weekly travel advisory.

298
00:18:36,866 --> 00:18:39,367
Set a meeting, a message is
encoded in the advisory,

299
00:18:39,369 --> 00:18:41,303
detailing where and when.

300
00:18:41,305 --> 00:18:43,538
The meeting is set
for the National Museum.

301
00:18:43,540 --> 00:18:45,807
You'll be going to Cuba
undercover, as tourists.

302
00:18:45,809 --> 00:18:48,142
He'll be going. Not me.

303
00:18:48,144 --> 00:18:51,145
You may be fine with doing this
job, no matter how you feel.

304
00:18:51,147 --> 00:18:52,613
- I can't.
- How you feel?

305
00:18:52,615 --> 00:18:55,449
How about how Keen feels?
Forget about<i> what</i> she did

306
00:18:55,451 --> 00:18:56,984
and try to figure out
<i>why</i> she did it.

307
00:18:56,986 --> 00:18:59,220
I have, and someday,
maybe I'll be okay with it.

308
00:18:59,222 --> 00:19:01,755
But right now I'm not.

309
00:19:01,757 --> 00:19:03,924
What?
You're okay with this?

310
00:19:03,926 --> 00:19:05,959
No.

311
00:19:05,961 --> 00:19:07,761
But for now, I accept it.

312
00:19:07,763 --> 00:19:11,332
You'll be going alone.
Here's how it's gonna work.

313
00:19:11,334 --> 00:19:13,133
Your agent will be detailed

314
00:19:13,135 --> 00:19:15,603
with the Dallas/Fort Worth
Arts and Cultural Committee.

315
00:19:15,605 --> 00:19:18,304
Esteban will expect to meet
at the Cafe Aventura

316
00:19:18,306 --> 00:19:20,306
across from
the National Museum.

317
00:19:20,308 --> 00:19:23,710
Once inside, take a table in
the back, order an egg coffee.

318
00:19:23,712 --> 00:19:25,779
I appreciate you
burning a source for this.

319
00:19:25,781 --> 00:19:29,216
You knowing he exists is
the least of Esteban's problems.

320
00:19:29,218 --> 00:19:31,985
Now that we're all chummy
with the Cubanos,

321
00:19:31,987 --> 00:19:34,387
his relationship
with the Agency is, uh,

322
00:19:34,389 --> 00:19:37,156
something of a liability.

323
00:19:37,158 --> 00:19:38,524
You're gonna scrub him?

324
00:19:38,526 --> 00:19:41,861
Let's just say, if you wanna
reach out to Esteban,

325
00:19:41,863 --> 00:19:43,796
you should do it quickly.

326
00:19:47,335 --> 00:19:49,835
Jesus. Hot as balls in here.

327
00:19:49,837 --> 00:19:51,637
You guys actually drink
this stuff?

328
00:20:15,796 --> 00:20:18,397
_

329
00:20:18,399 --> 00:20:22,066
Kill him first.
Come back for the cop.

330
00:20:22,068 --> 00:20:23,301
Meet you at that place.

331
00:20:53,800 --> 00:20:55,466
Aah!

332
00:20:55,468 --> 00:20:59,036
Hey! Get out of the car!
Get out of the car!

333
00:21:01,406 --> 00:21:02,840
Romina.

334
00:21:02,842 --> 00:21:04,107
- Move it.
- Hey.

335
00:21:07,046 --> 00:21:09,446
Hey.

336
00:21:09,448 --> 00:21:10,814
Let her go.

337
00:21:10,816 --> 00:21:12,482
Look, you can take me,
all right?

338
00:21:12,484 --> 00:21:13,783
Do whatever you want.
Just give me my little girl!

339
00:21:13,785 --> 00:21:18,455
Hey! I'm begging you!
Give me my little girl!

340
00:21:18,457 --> 00:21:19,922
Please!

341
00:21:24,929 --> 00:21:27,063
You and I are gonna have
some fun, man.

342
00:21:50,654 --> 00:21:52,320
- Hey.
- Shh.

343
00:21:52,322 --> 00:21:54,256
Don't talk.
They'll kill us.

344
00:21:54,258 --> 00:21:55,824
Where are we?

345
00:21:55,826 --> 00:21:57,826
How many people
does he have down there?

346
00:21:57,828 --> 00:22:01,497
My family.
They have a way out.

347
00:22:01,499 --> 00:22:04,099
He wants me to tell him how.

348
00:22:04,101 --> 00:22:05,733
He's going to kill me.

349
00:22:05,735 --> 00:22:08,270
I've seen his face.
Anyone who sees--

350
00:22:08,272 --> 00:22:12,107
It's him.

351
00:22:21,951 --> 00:22:23,684
Right. Upright.

352
00:22:27,524 --> 00:22:30,257
So the rumors are true.

353
00:22:30,259 --> 00:22:31,959
They sent you to finish me.

354
00:22:31,961 --> 00:22:33,160
Not quite, no.

355
00:22:33,162 --> 00:22:34,995
The Americans want me dead,

356
00:22:34,997 --> 00:22:37,631
so our relationship
dies with me,

357
00:22:37,633 --> 00:22:39,499
so I get embarrassed.

358
00:22:39,501 --> 00:22:41,335
Look, I'm not here
to kill you, pal,

359
00:22:41,337 --> 00:22:42,569
I'm here to tell you that

360
00:22:42,571 --> 00:22:44,405
Raymond Reddington wants
to see you.

361
00:22:44,407 --> 00:22:47,874
Oh, so now the US government
is Reddington's messenger.

362
00:22:47,876 --> 00:22:49,443
Oh, you know how it works.

363
00:22:49,445 --> 00:22:51,345
The American government
has deals

364
00:22:51,347 --> 00:22:52,813
with all kinds of scumbags.

365
00:22:58,520 --> 00:23:00,754
Look, I'll tell you
how it works.

366
00:23:00,756 --> 00:23:02,622
You're gonna give me
your phone.

367
00:23:05,561 --> 00:23:07,327
I'm gonna dial a number.

368
00:23:08,663 --> 00:23:11,897
Okay, cowboy.

369
00:23:11,899 --> 00:23:13,632
I like this one.

370
00:23:23,144 --> 00:23:24,777
Reddington?

371
00:23:24,779 --> 00:23:26,912
Manuel Esteban.

372
00:23:26,914 --> 00:23:29,682
My heavens, you're a devil
to get ahold of.

373
00:23:29,684 --> 00:23:32,084
I'm surprised we've never met.

374
00:23:32,086 --> 00:23:34,687
I'd like to have
a little chitchat.

375
00:23:34,689 --> 00:23:37,623
<i>How would you feel
about a blind date?</i>

376
00:23:40,897 --> 00:23:41,962
I'm looking for a woman.

377
00:23:41,964 --> 00:23:44,131
Aren't we all?

378
00:23:44,133 --> 00:23:46,133
Her name is Elizabeth Keen,

379
00:23:46,135 --> 00:23:49,869
and the man holding her
has the protection of the FAR.

380
00:23:49,871 --> 00:23:53,540
They know where she is, which
means you know where she is,

381
00:23:53,542 --> 00:23:57,077
or you could certainly find out.

382
00:23:57,079 --> 00:24:00,180
Why would I help you?
You're an anarchist.

383
00:24:00,182 --> 00:24:02,416
Probably.

384
00:24:02,418 --> 00:24:05,285
Maybe more
of an opportunist.

385
00:24:05,287 --> 00:24:08,021
And I have the opportunity
to help<i> you.</i>

386
00:24:08,023 --> 00:24:10,222
You spent a lifetime bouncing

387
00:24:10,224 --> 00:24:13,492
from one authoritarian regime
to the next.

388
00:24:13,494 --> 00:24:15,361
But this is the last stop.

389
00:24:15,363 --> 00:24:17,864
You're a relic.

390
00:24:17,866 --> 00:24:19,999
The detente between America
and Cuba

391
00:24:20,001 --> 00:24:21,901
makes you a man without
a country.

392
00:24:21,903 --> 00:24:24,370
Sooner or later,
both sides will want you dead.

393
00:24:24,372 --> 00:24:27,906
My money's on sooner.

394
00:24:27,908 --> 00:24:30,008
I can take care of myself.

395
00:24:33,414 --> 00:24:36,782
Clicking like a hairless
fruit bat is impressive, Manuel,

396
00:24:36,784 --> 00:24:39,618
but you and I both know
avoiding a lamppost

397
00:24:39,620 --> 00:24:44,155
is very different from
avoiding an assassin's bullet.

398
00:24:44,157 --> 00:24:48,126
Echo location can't help you
with that, but I can.

399
00:24:48,128 --> 00:24:49,427
What do you propose?

400
00:24:51,031 --> 00:24:53,431
I know what it's like
to be hunted.

401
00:24:53,433 --> 00:24:56,468
I've protected myself
for 30 years.

402
00:24:56,470 --> 00:24:58,903
And I can protect you...

403
00:24:58,905 --> 00:25:01,906
after you locate
Elizabeth Keen.

404
00:25:10,883 --> 00:25:14,284
All right,
listen to me, please.

405
00:25:14,286 --> 00:25:15,653
The baby-- I can pay you.

406
00:25:15,655 --> 00:25:17,588
- Quiet.
- Not me. I have a friend.

407
00:25:17,590 --> 00:25:18,823
Whatever you want,
he'll help you.

408
00:25:18,825 --> 00:25:20,424
We'll get you off the island,
he'll protect you.

409
00:25:20,426 --> 00:25:22,593
- I said quiet, man.
- Look, just let her go!

410
00:25:22,595 --> 00:25:24,228
All right, you can kill me.
I don't care.

411
00:25:24,230 --> 00:25:25,730
Just let my baby go.

412
00:25:33,139 --> 00:25:34,371
Let's go and dig.

413
00:25:55,694 --> 00:25:58,061
I know you don't want
to talk to me. Fine.

414
00:25:58,063 --> 00:25:59,195
Then listen.

415
00:26:01,966 --> 00:26:06,969
It was excruciating to watch you
mourn Elizabeth's death,

416
00:26:06,971 --> 00:26:10,273
to know that I was
making you endure that.

417
00:26:12,610 --> 00:26:14,677
Yes, I betrayed you,

418
00:26:14,679 --> 00:26:18,246
but only after
you had betrayed her.

419
00:26:19,550 --> 00:26:24,219
Raymond, you have to change.

420
00:26:24,221 --> 00:26:26,354
I took Elizabeth from you,

421
00:26:26,356 --> 00:26:29,291
and now I need your help
to get her back.

422
00:26:29,293 --> 00:26:32,260
But when you do,
as I'm sure you will,

423
00:26:32,262 --> 00:26:36,097
you have to let her go.

424
00:26:40,237 --> 00:26:41,769
Why don't you wait in the car?

425
00:26:49,646 --> 00:26:51,545
I have a location
for the girl.

426
00:26:53,016 --> 00:26:54,448
And the child?

427
00:26:54,450 --> 00:26:57,384
I asked, but people know nothing
about a child.

428
00:26:59,255 --> 00:27:00,855
Tell me about the location.

429
00:27:02,425 --> 00:27:04,291
It is heavily protected.

430
00:27:04,293 --> 00:27:07,161
20, maybe more.

431
00:27:07,163 --> 00:27:08,696
I'll need more men.

432
00:27:10,032 --> 00:27:12,799
That won't be necessary.

433
00:27:31,220 --> 00:27:32,953
I have a blood disorder.

434
00:27:32,955 --> 00:27:34,487
Good.

435
00:27:34,489 --> 00:27:36,957
I'm dying.

436
00:27:36,959 --> 00:27:39,192
Even better.

437
00:27:39,194 --> 00:27:41,361
They're here.

438
00:27:43,164 --> 00:27:46,899
Oh, baby.
Are you okay, sweetheart?

439
00:27:46,901 --> 00:27:49,302
Let me look at you.

440
00:27:49,304 --> 00:27:51,604
Oh, you're okay.

441
00:27:51,606 --> 00:27:54,073
Oh, my God.

442
00:27:54,075 --> 00:27:57,777
It's okay.
You're a strong girl.

443
00:27:57,779 --> 00:28:00,913
Everything's gonna be okay.
You're with Mommy now. Shh.

444
00:28:00,915 --> 00:28:02,314
She's beautiful.

445
00:28:04,152 --> 00:28:07,352
Yes? Yes, it's good to hear from you.

446
00:28:07,354 --> 00:28:09,255
You disappoint me, Balzan.

447
00:28:09,257 --> 00:28:12,291
Yes, yes, of... course.

448
00:28:12,293 --> 00:28:13,525
It's the pilot.

449
00:28:13,527 --> 00:28:16,395
Everything is on schedule.
I'll notify the men.

450
00:28:18,632 --> 00:28:22,567
I assume the husband's
been taken care of.

451
00:28:31,978 --> 00:28:33,812
<i>- Hello?</i>
- Is it done?

452
00:28:33,813 --> 00:28:36,343
_

453
00:28:37,750 --> 00:28:38,850
What's taking so long?

454
00:28:38,851 --> 00:28:40,831
_

455
00:28:40,832 --> 00:28:43,178
_

456
00:28:54,900 --> 00:28:56,133
<i>Angel.</i>

457
00:28:56,135 --> 00:28:57,335
Angel?

458
00:28:58,805 --> 00:28:59,970
<i>Angel.</i>

459
00:29:08,613 --> 00:29:11,315
He wants to talk to you.

460
00:29:11,317 --> 00:29:13,283
Hello. Who's this?

461
00:29:13,285 --> 00:29:15,518
<i>All that matters is that
you have a little girl,</i>

462
00:29:15,520 --> 00:29:17,120
<i>and you have her mother.</i>

463
00:29:17,122 --> 00:29:18,621
Tom.

464
00:29:18,623 --> 00:29:20,790
I'm coming for them,

465
00:29:20,792 --> 00:29:22,625
for you.

466
00:29:22,627 --> 00:29:24,126
And not just me, an army.

467
00:29:24,128 --> 00:29:26,963
<i>You hear me?</i>

468
00:29:26,965 --> 00:29:29,232
An army is coming for you.

469
00:29:54,982 --> 00:29:57,215
You lost Tom.

470
00:29:57,217 --> 00:29:58,584
We'll be going soon.

471
00:29:58,586 --> 00:30:00,085
Where?

472
00:30:00,087 --> 00:30:02,021
Home.

473
00:30:04,759 --> 00:30:06,291
I'm not going anywhere
with you.

474
00:30:07,929 --> 00:30:10,429
I faked my death
to have a normal life.

475
00:30:10,431 --> 00:30:13,565
There's nothing normal about
being held prisoner.

476
00:30:13,567 --> 00:30:15,567
A temporary inconvenience.

477
00:30:15,569 --> 00:30:17,936
You'll see in time that
the normal life you want,

478
00:30:17,938 --> 00:30:20,072
I'm the only one who can
give that to you.

479
00:30:24,010 --> 00:30:26,611
She's hungry,
which means I need to feed her,

480
00:30:26,613 --> 00:30:28,480
which means
you need to leave.

481
00:30:28,482 --> 00:30:30,014
Of course.

482
00:30:36,422 --> 00:30:38,890
I've done what I can,
but you must hurry.

483
00:30:38,892 --> 00:30:40,992
Kirk has chartered
a float plane.

484
00:30:40,994 --> 00:30:43,961
- There isn't much time.
- For either of us.

485
00:30:43,963 --> 00:30:46,130
A stevedore will meet you
on Pier 36.

486
00:30:46,132 --> 00:30:47,564
I've arranged for a berth

487
00:30:47,566 --> 00:30:49,800
on a container ship bound
for Caracas.

488
00:30:49,802 --> 00:30:52,002
Adios.

489
00:30:52,004 --> 00:30:54,037
We have an ETA
on that plane?

490
00:30:54,039 --> 00:30:55,606
Your job here
is done, Donald.

491
00:30:55,608 --> 00:30:56,873
Like hell it is.

492
00:30:56,875 --> 00:30:59,209
I came here to get Keen.
I'm not leaving without her.

493
00:30:59,211 --> 00:31:01,478
You think I'm gonna let you
tag along so you can inform

494
00:31:01,480 --> 00:31:02,979
the people who kidnapped
Elizabeth

495
00:31:02,981 --> 00:31:04,815
they have the right
to remain silent?

496
00:31:04,817 --> 00:31:06,749
I appreciate your assistance,

497
00:31:06,751 --> 00:31:10,586
but I'm not interested in having
an ethical debate with you

498
00:31:10,588 --> 00:31:12,322
about whether they have
the right to consult

499
00:31:12,324 --> 00:31:14,324
with an attorney before I put
a bullet in their head.

500
00:31:14,326 --> 00:31:15,525
Excuse me.

501
00:31:15,527 --> 00:31:18,061
What about that dirtball?
I suppose you think, uh,

502
00:31:18,063 --> 00:31:20,196
I should be okay
with letting him walk.

503
00:31:20,198 --> 00:31:21,631
It's entirely up to you.

504
00:31:21,633 --> 00:31:22,932
You made a deal with him.

505
00:31:22,934 --> 00:31:24,701
Yes, in order
to save Elizabeth,

506
00:31:24,703 --> 00:31:26,836
I made a deal with
the devil of the day.

507
00:31:26,838 --> 00:31:28,471
<i>I</i> did. You didn't.

508
00:31:28,473 --> 00:31:29,972
If you have a problem
with that,

509
00:31:29,974 --> 00:31:31,874
you've got 12 hours
before his ship leaves

510
00:31:31,876 --> 00:31:33,409
to do something about it.

511
00:31:33,411 --> 00:31:35,745
Otherwise,
safe travels home, Donald.

512
00:31:43,287 --> 00:31:45,120
Elizabeth?

513
00:31:45,122 --> 00:31:46,588
Ready to go?

514
00:31:53,296 --> 00:31:55,330
Balzan!

515
00:31:55,332 --> 00:31:57,699
Balzan!

516
00:31:57,701 --> 00:32:01,202
He's gone. Your guards,
your security, they're all gone.

517
00:32:01,204 --> 00:32:02,904
The child and the girl--
find them.

518
00:32:06,510 --> 00:32:07,709
This is Agent Mojtabi.

519
00:32:07,711 --> 00:32:08,943
Aram, it's Tom.

520
00:32:08,945 --> 00:32:10,478
<i>Tom? Hey. Tell me
you're with Agent Keen.</i>

521
00:32:10,480 --> 00:32:11,579
The man who took Agnes--

522
00:32:11,581 --> 00:32:13,814
he's driving a blue Dodge sedan,
late '50s,

523
00:32:13,816 --> 00:32:16,084
He's taking her straight to Liz.
If we can follow the car--

524
00:32:16,086 --> 00:32:18,086
We can find them. Okay,
let me think. Let me think.

525
00:32:18,088 --> 00:32:19,754
<i>Okay, what I'm thinking
is, um,</i>

526
00:32:19,756 --> 00:32:21,822
did you help Agent Keen
fake her death?

527
00:32:21,824 --> 00:32:23,591
Aram!

528
00:32:23,593 --> 00:32:25,659
Not helpful, I know.
Okay. But did you?

529
00:32:25,661 --> 00:32:27,561
At the funeral, when you put
a flower on her casket--

530
00:32:27,563 --> 00:32:29,663
The car--
it has an old tube radio.

531
00:32:29,665 --> 00:32:32,065
<i>- Local oscillator.</i>
- The oscillator. Right. Of course.

532
00:32:32,067 --> 00:32:34,067
Okay, if you could rewire it,

533
00:32:34,069 --> 00:32:36,303
you might be able to turn
the PLL receiver into this--

534
00:32:36,305 --> 00:32:38,105
<i>...into a low power
mono FM transmitter</i>

535
00:32:38,107 --> 00:32:40,508
that produces a signal that you
can trace. Yeah. I know.

536
00:32:40,510 --> 00:32:42,442
You do?
Then, uh, why are you...

537
00:32:42,444 --> 00:32:44,878
To get you to trace
the signal, Aram.

538
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:47,014
<i>Oh. Oh, you already...
uh...</i>

539
00:32:47,016 --> 00:32:49,549
Wow, that's, uh,
that is impressive.

540
00:32:49,551 --> 00:32:51,385
Okay. Hang on. I'm on it.

541
00:32:51,387 --> 00:32:53,586
- Thank you.
- <i>Did you know?</i>

542
00:32:53,588 --> 00:32:55,789
At the christening,

543
00:32:55,791 --> 00:32:57,925
when you made me a godfather
to Agnes--

544
00:32:57,927 --> 00:32:59,225
Look, man, I know
you're upset, all right?

545
00:32:59,227 --> 00:33:00,560
But right now is not
the time.

546
00:33:00,562 --> 00:33:03,963
I'm trying to ping the signal.
Waiting for a reply...

547
00:33:03,965 --> 00:33:05,231
from both of you.

548
00:33:05,233 --> 00:33:07,801
Aram...

549
00:33:07,803 --> 00:33:09,068
of course I knew.

550
00:33:12,808 --> 00:33:14,908
I'll let you know when, uh,
I find the signal.

551
00:33:14,910 --> 00:33:16,442
Thank you.

552
00:33:18,746 --> 00:33:21,347
Shh, shh, shh.

553
00:33:21,349 --> 00:33:23,649
Shh. Shh.

554
00:33:28,722 --> 00:33:32,190
Please, Agnes, stop crying.
Mommy's here.

555
00:33:32,192 --> 00:33:34,460
Shh, shh, shh.

556
00:33:53,813 --> 00:33:55,947
Think about
what you're doing.

557
00:33:55,949 --> 00:33:57,782
What are you gonna do?
Hurt me?

558
00:33:57,784 --> 00:34:00,418
Hurt my baby?

559
00:34:00,420 --> 00:34:02,520
Kirk will kill you if you do.

560
00:34:02,522 --> 00:34:05,089
Are you a mother?
Do you have children?

561
00:34:05,091 --> 00:34:07,091
Look at her...

562
00:34:21,673 --> 00:34:22,906
Hey!

563
00:34:29,415 --> 00:34:30,981
No!

564
00:34:30,983 --> 00:34:33,950
Little mama,
you got spirit.

565
00:34:33,952 --> 00:34:35,219
Get up. Get the baby.

566
00:34:49,034 --> 00:34:51,001
You'll learn to trust me.

567
00:34:51,003 --> 00:34:52,335
Get the baby and the things.
We're leaving.

568
00:34:52,337 --> 00:34:55,104
Like hell we are.

569
00:34:55,106 --> 00:34:56,372
No!

570
00:34:56,374 --> 00:34:57,840
I wish there was
another way, I do,

571
00:34:57,842 --> 00:35:00,676
- but Reddington's on his way.
- Agnes!

572
00:35:00,678 --> 00:35:04,180
Come on. Get her onboard.

573
00:35:04,182 --> 00:35:07,517
Yeah.

574
00:35:07,519 --> 00:35:10,253
<i>- Mr. Reddington. It's Aram.</i>
- It's not a good time.

575
00:35:10,255 --> 00:35:12,621
I have information
on Agent Keen. A location.

576
00:35:12,623 --> 00:35:13,722
<i>She's being held
near this--</i>

577
00:35:13,724 --> 00:35:16,491
A small fishing port
in Playa Larga.

578
00:35:16,493 --> 00:35:18,561
- We're on our way.
<i>- Oh.</i>

579
00:35:18,563 --> 00:35:19,695
Magic. How'd you do that?

580
00:35:19,697 --> 00:35:20,763
<i>We'll have Elizabeth shortly.</i>

581
00:35:20,765 --> 00:35:21,830
And Agnes.

582
00:35:21,832 --> 00:35:24,199
- Agnes?
<i>- Right. Tom called.</i>

583
00:35:24,201 --> 00:35:25,701
<i>Thanks to him, I was able
to track the vehicle</i>

584
00:35:25,703 --> 00:35:29,471
<i>where he had last seen Agnes,
a blue Dodge sedan.</i>

585
00:35:29,473 --> 00:35:31,373
Thank you, Aram.

586
00:35:31,375 --> 00:35:33,808
Agnes is here.

587
00:35:38,615 --> 00:35:39,914
Luis, you and your men take

588
00:35:39,916 --> 00:35:41,950
the perimeters to the north
and the west.

589
00:35:41,952 --> 00:35:43,452
Dembe, secure the house.

590
00:35:43,454 --> 00:35:45,519
Silvio, you're with me
to the south.

591
00:35:45,521 --> 00:35:46,988

I'm sorry, Raymond.

610
00:38:18,484 --> 00:38:19,850
We have her.

611
00:38:22,121 --> 00:38:24,855
You told them
he worked for us?

612
00:38:24,857 --> 00:38:26,123
Do you have any idea

613
00:38:26,125 --> 00:38:28,792
what kind of blowback
I'm dealing with here?

614
00:38:28,794 --> 00:38:31,728
<i>And it doesn't take long to
find out who told the Cubans.</i>

615
00:38:31,730 --> 00:38:33,396
I heard it was
an anonymous tip.

616
00:38:33,398 --> 00:38:34,564
Agent Ressler...

617
00:38:34,566 --> 00:38:36,500
Are you a traitor
or-- or just a moron?

618
00:38:36,502 --> 00:38:39,569
Look, the Agency was gonna
assassinate Esteban...

619
00:38:39,571 --> 00:38:40,971
I have
no direct knowledge--

620
00:38:40,973 --> 00:38:42,572
<i>...so the Cubans wouldn't
find out</i>

621
00:38:42,574 --> 00:38:44,073
who was feeding secrets
to the CIA.

622
00:38:44,075 --> 00:38:45,541
Whoever this
anonymous source is,

623
00:38:45,543 --> 00:38:46,709
he just saved a lot of lives.

624
00:38:46,711 --> 00:38:47,776
What are you talking about?

625
00:38:47,778 --> 00:38:48,844
Now that America knows about

626
00:38:48,846 --> 00:38:50,246
Esteban's
little torture chamber,

627
00:38:50,248 --> 00:38:52,115
the Cubans are going to want
plausible deniability.

628
00:38:52,117 --> 00:38:55,118
_

629
00:38:55,119 --> 00:38:56,408
_

630
00:38:56,912 --> 00:38:58,352
_

631
00:38:58,353 --> 00:39:02,111
_

632
00:39:02,146 --> 00:39:03,358
Let's not mince words.

633
00:39:03,360 --> 00:39:05,961
You took it upon yourself
to tell the Cubans about our--

634
00:39:05,963 --> 00:39:08,697
<i>No, I took it upon myself
to stop what Esteban was doing.</i>

635
00:39:08,699 --> 00:39:10,666
Do you have any idea
what that was?

636
00:39:10,668 --> 00:39:14,336
No, because all you care about is
what Esteban was doing for you.

637
00:39:14,338 --> 00:39:17,105
There are bigger issues,
Agent Ressler.

638
00:39:17,107 --> 00:39:20,208
<i>Torture, abuse, murder.</i>

639
00:39:20,210 --> 00:39:23,078
I don't see any bigger issues
than that.

640
00:39:26,316 --> 00:39:27,516
Excuse me.

641
00:39:29,786 --> 00:39:31,753
Have you heard
from Reddington?

642
00:39:31,755 --> 00:39:33,487
No.

643
00:39:33,489 --> 00:39:34,889
Uh, last time
I spoke to him,

644
00:39:34,891 --> 00:39:36,624
he was on his way
to the location

645
00:39:36,626 --> 00:39:38,292
where Agent Keen was
being held.

646
00:39:38,294 --> 00:39:40,394
I'm sure he'll call.
I'm sure they're okay.

647
00:39:45,201 --> 00:39:47,936
I think you were wrong
not going to Cuba.

648
00:39:47,938 --> 00:39:50,237
I'm not saying what Agent Keen
did was right,

649
00:39:50,239 --> 00:39:52,206
but as long as her life
is in danger,

650
00:39:52,208 --> 00:39:54,208
as long as Agnes's life
is in danger,

651
00:39:54,210 --> 00:39:56,410
I think we have to put
our feelings aside.

652
00:39:56,412 --> 00:39:58,879
What's happening to Liz
is her own fault.

653
00:39:58,881 --> 00:40:02,083
I know that sounds harsh,
but it's true.

654
00:40:02,085 --> 00:40:03,684
She made decisions
that have consequences,

655
00:40:03,686 --> 00:40:05,086
and now she has to live
with them.

656
00:40:05,088 --> 00:40:07,621
- She's in trouble.
- I know, and I'm angry about that.

657
00:40:07,623 --> 00:40:09,189
because if she'd
behaved differently,

658
00:40:09,191 --> 00:40:10,591
she wouldn't be
in this position.

659
00:40:10,593 --> 00:40:12,192
But she is.
And no matter how we feel,

660
00:40:12,194 --> 00:40:14,628
I think we have to do
something about it.

661
00:40:14,630 --> 00:40:16,763
I don't.

662
00:40:24,706 --> 00:40:27,907
If you don't help,

663
00:40:27,909 --> 00:40:32,078
and something happens
to Agent Keen or Agnes,

664
00:40:32,080 --> 00:40:34,581
I know you.

665
00:40:34,583 --> 00:40:36,583
You won't be able
to live with yourself.

666
00:40:47,328 --> 00:40:49,495
Yes? It's Tom.

667
00:40:49,497 --> 00:40:51,230
Tell him we were too late.

668
00:40:51,232 --> 00:40:52,698
Kirk has Elizabeth.

669
00:40:52,700 --> 00:40:53,766
What about Agnes?

670
00:40:53,768 --> 00:40:56,034
<i>She's with us. Safe.</i>

671
00:40:56,036 --> 00:40:57,569
Your daughter is safe.

672
00:41:18,725 --> 00:41:20,792
Raymond, I've been thinking
about where we go from here--

673
00:42:20,397 --> 00:42:25,431
